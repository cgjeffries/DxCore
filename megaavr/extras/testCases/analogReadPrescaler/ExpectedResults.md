# Expected Results for this Test Case

The results for this test case should remain a constant value, 
just with slighlty varying accuracy based on how many samples are being taken per second.  

This would be an example with a constant signal of 1.25V.  

Result with 2 as the prescaler: 390  
Result with 4 as the prescaler: 390  
Result with 8 as the prescaler: 390  
Result with 12 as the prescaler: 390  
Result with 16 as the prescaler: 390  
Result with 20 as the prescaler: 390  
Result with 24 as the prescaler: 390  
Result with 28 as the prescaler: 390  
Result with 32 as the prescaler: 390  
Result with 48 as the prescaler: 390  
Result with 64 as the prescaler: 390  
Result with 96 as the prescaler: 390  
Result with 128 as the prescaler: 390  
Result with 256 as the prescaler: 390  
Result with 190 as the prescaler: 390
