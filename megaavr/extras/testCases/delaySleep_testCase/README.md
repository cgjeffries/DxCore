# `delaySleep` Test Case
This test case validates the `delaySleep` function. 

## Instructions
1. Connect the Curiosity nano board to your computer
2. Connect the curiosity nano power supply in series with an ammeter such as a multimeter or AVR power debugger (recommended). The Ammeter must have precise timing abilities.
3. Download the sketch to the board.
4. Observe on the ammeter that once every 3 seconds the system enters sleep for exactly SLEEP_TIME milliseconds, which is 1300 milliseconds by default.
