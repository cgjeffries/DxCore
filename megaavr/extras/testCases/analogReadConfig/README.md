# ADC analogReadConfig Case
This test case demonstrates the usage and output of the analogReadConfig function.

## Instructions
3. Upload the `analogReadConfig.ino` sketch to your AVRDA board.
4. Open a serial monitor to view the recorded readings.

## Results
The output shows the inital board ADC configuration, updated default 
configuration, and an arbitrary configuration. Along with the output is an 
"EXPECTED OUTPUT" row for verification.
