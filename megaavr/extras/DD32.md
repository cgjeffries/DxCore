## AVR DD32 - Povery model DB without the opamps and fewer peripherals, but with a bunch of errata fixes and added port mappings

That basically sums up the DD28 and DD32 parts. They're much cheaper than DB-series, barely above ATtiny parts, but come with most of the full suite of features. Obviously some things were cut versus the DB - they still come in three sizes, but the sizes have half the flash. There is only 1 analog comparator and no USART2, and we're down to just one SPI and I2C peripheral. On the other hand, the pin multipleximg options of USART0 and SPI0 have gotten luxury treatment. Note also that the alternate pin mapping numbers don't start at 1.

The 8 pins that the 32-pin parts pick up versus the 28-pin parts are PF0-3 - not very exciting for the big-three serial interfaces, but wonderful for PWM, as those largely unpopulated pins on PORTF are perfect for TCA0.

### Fully async pins
All pins on the DDs are supposedly fully async, instead of just pins 2 and 6 within each port. Whether this is actually a good thing or not can be debated.

### USART0 mux options
(options for which no pins are available are not listed, and options missing critical pins or which are strictly worse than another pinset are ~structhrough~)

| USART0  |  TX |  RX | XDIR | XCK |
|---------|-----|-----|------|-----|
| DEFAULT | PA0 | PA1 |  PA2 | PA3 |
| ALT1    | PA4 | PA5 |  PA6 | PA7 |
| ALT2    | PA2 | PA3 |   -  |  -  |
| ALT3    | PD4 | PD5 |  PD6 | PD7 |
| ALT4    | PC1 | PC2 |  PC3 |  -  |


### USART1 mux options
| USART1  |  TX |  RX | XDIR | XCK |
|---------|-----|-----|------|-----|
| DEFAULT | PC0 | PC1 |  PC2 | PC3 |
| ALT2    | PD6 | PD7 |   -  |  -  |


### SPI0 mux options
| SPI0    | MOSI | MISO | SCK |  SS |
|---------|------|------|-----|-----|
| DEFAULT |  PA4 |  PA5 | PA6 | PA7 |
| ALT3    |  PA0 |  PA1 | PC0 | PC1 |
| ALT4    |  PD4 |  PD5 | PD6 | PD7 |
| ALT5    |  PC0 |  PC1 | PC2 | PC3 |
| ALT6    |  PC1 |  PC2 | PC3 | PF7 |


### TWI0 mux options
| Mapping | swap | Master or Slave   | Dual Mode Slave   |
|---------|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| DEFAULT | 0    | SDA/PA2 SCL/PA3   | SDA/PC2 SCL/PC3   |
| ~ALT1~  | ~1~  | ~SDA/PA2 SCL/PA3~ | ~SDA/PC6 SCL/PC7~ |
| ALT2    | 2    | SDA/PC2 SCL/PC3   | ~SDA/PC6 SCL/PC7~ |
| ALT3    | 3    | SDA/PA0 SCL/PA1   | SDA/PC2 SCL/PC3   |

Note that this means that you want Wire.swap(0, 2, or 3, but not 1).

### PWM Pins
Finally, at 32 pins, we see some action in the PWM pins.
* TCA0 can get it's full suite of pins on either PORTA or PORTF. With other peripherals occupying pins on PORTA, we use PORTF by default.
* TCD0 again makes sense on DEFAULT or ALT4 (ALT2 not being used unless TCA is moved elsewhere).
* All TCBs can PWM - though the alt pins overlap with those of TCA0, and one is usually used for millis; if a TCB is used for millis timekeeping, it can't be used for PWM.
* This means by default, PF0-5, PA6-7, and PA2-3 will be available for PWM. Changing the millis timer can get you PWM on PC0, at a cost of less efficient millis timekeeping (using TCA0), or the loss of PWM on PA2 or 3.

#### TCA0 mux options
The Type A timers (TCA0) can be mapped to different pins as a group only, and analogWrite() is PORTMUX-aware - you can set TCA0 to output on any port's pin 0-5. Using this feature is easy - you simply write to the portmux register `PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA = (TCA0 pinset)` and then analogWrite() normally. TCA0 pinset is the port number (0-5 for ports A-F), or one of the named constants of the form: PORTMUX_TCA0_PORTx_gc where x is A, C, D or F.

| TCA0    | WO0 | WO1 | WO2 | WO3 | WO4 | WO5 |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| PORTA   | PA0 | PA1 | PA2 | PA3 | PA4 | PA5 |
| PORTC   |  -  | PC1 | PC2 | PC3 |  -  |  -  |
| PORTD   |  -  | PD1 | PD2 | PD3 | PD4 | PD5 |
| **PORTF** | **PF0** | **PF1** | **PF2** | **PF3** | **PF4** | **PF5** |

It is strongly recommended to not have any PWM output enabled involving either the timer being moved nor the pins it is being moved to when setting `PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA`. In the latter case, you will not be able to turn off the existing PWM through the API functions. Simple assignment can and should be used to write to the PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA register. This is the only bitfield there, so you needn't worry about stomping on anything else.

#### TCB mux options
| TCBn | Default | Alt |
|------|---------|-----|
| TCB0 | **PA2** | PF4 |
| TCB1 | **PA3** | PF5 |
| TCB2 | **PC0** |  -  |

Default mappings are used, since PF4/5 are shared with the preferred TCA pins, which take priority. These are NOT PORTMUX-aware. Only the **bold** pin can be used without modifying or creating a new variant file.

The type B timers are much better utility timers than PWM timers. TCB2 is the default millis timer and cannot be used for PWM in that mode.

#### TCD0 mux options
| TCD0    | WOA | WOB | WOC | WOD |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| **DEFAULT** | **PA4** | **PA5** | **PA6** | **PA7** |
| ALT2    | PF0 | PF1 | PF2 | PF3 |
| ALT4    | PA4 | PA5 | PD4 | PD5 |

Like TCA, in 1.5.0 of DxCore, if you set the TCD portmux (`PORTMUX.TCDROUTEA`), digitalWrite() and analogWrite() will be aware of it (digitalWriteFast is never aware of PWM, don't try to use it to shut off PWM, it won't - turning off PWM is most of the overhead we're getting rid of with digitalWriteFast()!).

TCA is used in preference to TCD when both are available on one pin with a given mux setting. Since default is usable, ALT2 overlaps with the clear winner for TCA, and ALT4 uses the two more useful of these 4 pins or the 3rd and 4th most useful non-MVIO pins - PD was a wasteland on the DA, analog stuff only on the DB, but now it's a hub of communication.

### LED_BUILTIN
To match other parts, `PIN_PA7` shall be the pin that the core "expects" to be connected to an LED. If you want to have a different pin be recognized by the application (this does not change the bootloader - you would still need to do a custom build of that too), this can be overridden if a custom board definition is created by passing `-DLED_BUILTIN=(some other pin)` as part of build_extra_flags, building via the CLI, or by equivalent means provided by other third party development environments.

## Official Documentation
When all else fails, read the real documentation. They keep moving the .pdf files around, so now I just link to the prduct page, from whence the datasheet, errata, and "technical briefs" are linked.

**Datasheets and errata change. You can sign up to get emails about such changes through the Microchip PCN system; if you don't, be sure to always use the latest version of the datasheet and especially the errata**

* [AVR64DD32 product page](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/AVR64DD32)
* [AVR32DD32 product page](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/AVR32DD32)
* [AVR16DD32 product page](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/AVR16DD32)

At a minimum, everyone using a modern AVR and going beyond the API provided by the core should plan on having a PDF viewer open with the datasheet, and a text editor with a good search function with the ioavr______.h file open so that when you're trying to use a constant, and can't figure out how it was spelled/formatted (see [the IO headers](./ioheaders) page for more information and links to them viewable online), plus a web browser open to the core documentation. I also keep the AVR instruction set manual open in the PDF viewer (since I often write asm, or need to consider how the compiler renders my code) as well as the Silicon Errata and Datasheet Clarification (this is less crucial here than on the DA/DB, though. The difference between a Silicon Erratum and a Datasheet Clarification is twofold, but subtle:
1. Datasheet Clarifications mean "We meant to do it this way, or we're going to pretend we did" , while an erratum says "Okay, yeah this isn't right, but we'll fix it some day, maybe"
2. Datasheet Clarifications get incorporated into the datasheet **and then removed from the Silicon Errata and Datasheet Clarification** to cover their tracks. That means that if you were familiar with what the datasheet used to say, that's not enough, you need to know what it says *in the most recent version*. The changes aren't highlighted for you or anything (probably because they're usually less than flattering). Most Datasheet Clarifications are things that would probably be errata, except that Microchip doesn't know how to fix it, or knows that doing so would be too expensive in engineering time) - though a few of them do appear to be purely documentation issues. The AVR DA/DB changed how the EDGE bit works on the TCB (having apparently realized that you can just invert the pin if you want )

For that second reason, I keep as many versions of the datasheets, ATPACKs and errata as I can get my hands on. Sometimes gems get airbrushed out. How else would I know when they had, say, cut a specification by an order of magnitude, or removed an option from a peripheral using only their word processor? (as in, without using whatever CAD tools are used to design microcontrollers - hence the feature they "removed" is still there (Ex: the 4x PLL multiplier, AC power profile 3, and quite possibly the second RS485 mode of serial ports)

### Technical briefs
Technical briefs are what Microchip calls the sort of documents that most of the industry refers to as "app notes". "Technical brief" is an apt term, as it covers the wide range of usefulness and detail that can be seen in the technical briefs: Some of these are briefs as in a briefing, like what would be given to a military commander for making strategic decisions, and are highly useful. Other "technical briefs" are simply "brief", that is, short. While brevity is by no means necessarily bad, in documentation it often is, and some of these cover a topic that deserves several times as much discussion. There are also an unfortunate few of the "technical briefs" that are even less helpful; in this case, it's "brief" in the sense of the article of clothing: they covers ones ass and not much else ("Yeah, we have a technical brief explaining that functionality, absolutely!"). While they may be a starting point, you'd need a lot more to go anywhere. One gets the impression that there is a wide variation in the level of understanding that the writers have. Some technical briefs were clearly written by someone who knows the feature at a very deep level, and is writing with the benefit of a great deal of information that itself can't be released, even if it's ramifications can be. These are the first kind of tech brief. Others are written somewhat more abstractly, as if the writer has understanding, but may not have actually used it to achieve a goal themselves without a cheatsheet. The worst tech briefs amount to little more than paraphrasing the datasheet and maybe a scrawled set of notes from engineering scrawled on a napkin when the documentation guy cornered the relevant engineer in the cafeteria, and are more lexographical than technical.

A fairly large portion of tech briefs are *essentially useless*, or at least nearly so - but there are also some really insightful and solid ones that are of great utility. They cannot be distinguished without starting to read them (though the number of pages is often a good indicater), but once you start reading, by the end of the first page, it's pretty obviout whether the writer was in uniform (first case) or their underwear (third case)
