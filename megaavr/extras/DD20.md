* If targeting the most PWM channels, the only option for the two TCBs overlaps with pins that TCA can use in it's most favorable spot.
* VQFN is the ultra-tiny 3mm x 3mm 0.4mm pitch one. 64k DD20s are not available in VQFN as of the time of writing and in fact may never be (maybe the die just won't fit?

## AVR DD - This is more akin to a souped up tinyAVR than an poverty model Dx
The 20 and 14 pin DD-series parts first released were 32k and 16k parts with the 64-pin version following later in 2022 (but apparently only in SOIC package), are much more exciting than their larger brothers, because they bring in Dx-class features at a price barely exceeding that of a tinyAVR. They're much cheaper than DB-series, barely above ATtiny parts - but they come with most of the full suite of features. Obviously some things were cut versus the DB - memory being the most obvious, and the peripheral count is lower as one would expect for a smaller device with fewer pins. But it has the

### Fully async pins
All pins on the DDs are supposedly fully async, instead of just pins 2 and 6 within each port. Whether this is actually a good thing or not can be debated.

### USART0 mux options
| USART0  | swap |  TX |  RX | XDIR | XCK |
|---------|------|-----|-----|------|-----|
| DEFAULT | 0    | PA0 | PA1 |  PA2 | PA3 |
| ALT1    | 1    | PA4 | PA5 |  PA6 | PA7 |
| ALT2    | 2    | PA2 | PA3 |   -  |  -  |
| ALT3    | 3    | PD4 | PD5 |  PD6 | PD7 |
| ALT4    | 4    | PC1 | PC2 |  PC3 |  -  |

### USART1 mux options
| USART1  | swap |  TX |  RX | XDIR | XCK |
|---------|------|-----|-----|------|-----|
| ~DEFAULT~ | ~0~ | ~-~ | ~PC1~ | ~PC2~ | ~PC3~ |
| ALT2    | 2    | PD6 | PD7 |   -  |  -  |

As default is kinda useless, USART1 defaults to swap(2).

### SPI0 mux options
| SPI0    | swap | MOSI | MISO | SCK |  SS |
|---------|------|------|------|-----|-----|
| DEFAULT | 0    |  PA4 |  PA5 | PA6 | PA7 |
| ~ALT3~  | ~3~  | ~PA0~ | ~PA1~ | ~-~ | ~PC1~ |
| ALT4    | 4    |  PD4 |  PD5 | PD6 | PD7 |
| ~ALT5~  | ~5~  |  ~-~ | ~PC1~ | ~PC2~ | ~PC3~ |
| ALT6    | 6    |  PC1 |  PC2 | PC3 | PF7 |

ALT5 and ALT3 are not particularly useful, as they are both lacking one of the critical pins. ALT6 however gives you SPI on the right pins of PORTC to be useful for MVIO, while DEFAULT or ALT4 gives you non-MVIO-referenced SPI levels.

### TWI0 mux options
| Mapping | swap | Master or Slave | Dual Mode Slave |
|---------|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| DEFAULT | 0    | SDA/PA2 SCL/PA3 | SDA/PC2 SCL/PC3 |
| ~ALT1~  | ~1~  | ~SDA/PA2 SCL/PA3~ | ~Not avail.~  |
| ALT2    | 2    | SDA/PC2 SCL/PC3 | Not avail.      |
| ALT3    | 3    | SDA/PA0 SCL/PA1 | SDA/PC2 SCL/PC3 |

Note that this means that you want Wire.swap(0, 2, or 3, but not 1). PA0 and PA1 are unavailable if using an external crystal.

### PWM Pins
With 20 pins, there still isn't a whole lot of choice...
* TCA0 obviously wants to be on PORTA, the only port with more than half of it's outputs.
* TCD0 can go either way as required, we leave it at default.
* The TCBs don't get used for PWM - they share PA2 and PA3 with TCA0, and no different PORTMUX option can return at least the three pins you lose from switching to PORTC instead of PORTA, though they will be used if PORTMUX is set to point TCA0 to a port other than PORTA, and the timer isn't being used for millis, which TCB1 usually is.

#### TCA mux options
The Type A timers (TCA0) can be mapped to different pins as a group only, and analogWrite() is PORTMUX-aware - you can set TCA0 to output on any port's pin 0-5. Using this feature is easy - you simply write to the portmux register `PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA = (TCA0 pinset)` and then analogWrite() normally. TCA0 pinset is the port number (0-5 for ports A-F), or one of the named constants of the form: PORTMUX_TCA0_PORTx_gc where x is A, C, or D.
| TCA0    | WO0 | WO1 | WO2 | WO3 | WO4 | WO5 |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| **PORTA** | **PA0** | **PA1** | **PA2** | **PA3** | **PA4** | **PA5** |
| PORTC   |  -  | PC1 | PC2 | PC3 |  -  |  -  |
| PORTD   |  -  | PD1 | PD2 | PD3 | PD4 | PD5 |

#### TCB mux options
| TCBn | Default | Alt |
|------|---------|-----|
| TCB0 | **PA2** |  -  |
| TCB1 | **PA3** |  -  |

Not much of a choice, and are not used by default since those pins are shared with the "best" TCA0 mapping.

#### TCD0 mux options
| TCD0    | WOA | WOB | WOC | WOD |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| **DEFAULT** | **PA4** | **PA5** | **PA6** | **PA7** |
| ALT4    | PA4 | PA5 | PD4 | PD5 |

Like TCA, in 1.5.0 of DxCore, if you set the TCD portmux (`PORTMUX.TCDROUTEA`), digitalWrite and analogWrite() will be aware of it (digitalWriteFast is never aware of PWM, don't use it to shut off PWM, it won't). TCA is used in preference to TCD when both are available on one pin. Since default is usable, we don't change it.

### LED_BUILTIN
Thank god - we have a PA7 here!

To match other parts, `PIN_PA7` shall be the pin that the core "expects" to be connected to an LED. If you want to have a different pin be recognized by the application (this does not change the bootloader - you would still need to do a custom build of that too), this can be overridden if a custom board definition is created by passing `-DLED_BUILTIN=(some other pin)` as part of build_extra_flags, building via the CLI, or by equivalent means provided by other third party development environments.

## Official Documentation
When all else fails, read the real documentation. They keep moving the .pdf files around, so now I just link to the prduct page, from whence the datasheet, errata, and "technical briefs".

* [AVR64DD20 product page](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/AVR64DD20)
* [AVR32DD20 product page](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/AVR32DD20)
* [AVR16DD20 product page](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/AVR32DD20)

At a minimum, everyone using a modern AVR should plan on having a PDF viewer open with the datasheet, and a text editor with a good search function and the `ioavr______.h` file open so that when you're trying to use a constant, but the compiler says it isn't declared/defined, you can search the io header for a key phrase in the constant and figure out how it was spelled/formatted or copy/paste it to your sketch. (see [the IO headers](./ioheaders) for more information and links to them. I also keep the AVR instruction set manual open in the PDF viewer as well as the silicon errata and datasheet clarification. Datasheet clarifications are a bigger deal than an erratum, usually. An erratum says "Okay, this doesn't work, but it will some day, maybe" while a datasheet clarification says either "This would be an errata, but we're not even going to pretend that we'll fix it some day" or occasionally "there is poor communication between the engineering and documentation departments".

### Technical briefs
Technical briefs are what Microchip calls the sort of documents that most of the industry refers to as "app notes". Technical brief is an apt term, as it covers the wide range of usefulness and detail that can be seen in the technical briefs: Some of these are briefs as in a briefing, like what would be given to a military commander for making strategic decisions, and are highly useful. Other "technical briefs" are simply "brief", that is, short. This is not always bad, but sometimes a technical brief ends up FAR too brief and covers a topic that deserves considerably more discussion (the "product brief" is the extreme of this - in the past what is now called a "product brief" may have been called a "datasheet summary". There are also nn unfortunate few of the "technical briefs" that are even less helpful. Here the name is still apt, but in this case, it's in the sense of the article of clothing of that name: they cover the ass ("Yeah, we have a technical brief explaining that functionality"), but achieve little more. While they may be a starting point, you'd need a lot more to go anywhere. One gets the impression that the tech briefs are sometimes written by people who really know how the feature works at a very deep level, resulting in useful informative documents, others are written somewhat more abstractly, as if the writer has understanding, but little realworld experience, and in the worst tech briefs, it seems to have been written by someone who has no actual eperience using the features, and are going completely from the datasheet and maybe a scrawled set of notes from engineering - but are writing with precious little understanding.

A fair portion of tech briefs are essentially useless - but there are also some really insightful and solid ones that are of great utility. They cannot be distinguished without reading them, but once you start reading, you very rapidly will realize which kind you have.
