## DB64 - the improved 64-pin Dx-series part
Take a DA64. Remove the PTC which we can't use from within Arduino, and the TCA1 PORTMUX erratum. Add MVIO, support for an external crystal, a trio of OPAMPs and you've got the DB64. 64-pins gets the last USART, ZCD, OPAMP and TCB, plus an extra pinset for each SPI port, and 2 for TWI1. This is a much smaller step-change than 32-48, though peripheral density remains high by historical standards. There is no 32k flash version. Silicon rev. A4, which is crippled by errata, did not make it out the door in quantity.

### Fully async pins
Pins 2 and 6 within each port are "fully async" and can respond to events shorter than 1 clock cycle, and can wake the pin on RISING or FALLING edges, not just LOW_LEVEL and CHANGE.

### USART mux options
This is very simple - All ports except PORTD have a USART, and it's on pins 0, 1, 2 and 3 of that port, or the alternate mux option is selected and it's on pins 4, 5, 6 and 7.
| All     |  TX |  RX | XDIR | XCK |
|---------|-----|-----|------|-----|
| DEFAULT | Px0 | Px1 |  Px2 | Px3 |
| ALT1    | Px4 | Px5 |  Px6 | Px7 |

Px refers to a port; as with many things, ports appear in the order A, C, D, F, B, E, G.
| USART | PORT  |
|-------|-------|
| 0     | PORTA |
| 1     | PORTC |
| 2     | PORTF |
| 3     | PORTB |
| 4     | PORTE |
| 5     | PORTG |

All ports have both mappings available.

### SPI  mux options
| SPI          | Swap name  | MOSI | MISO | SCK |  SS |
|--------------|------------|------|------|-----|-----|
| SPI0 DEFAULT | SPI0_SWAP0 |  PA4 |  PA5 | PA6 | PA7 |
| SPI0 ALT1    | SPI0_SWAP1 |  PE0 |  PE1 | PE2 | PE3 |
| SPI0 ALT2    | SPI0_SWAP2 |  PG4 |  PG5 | PG6 | PG7 |
| SPI1 DEFAULT | SPI1_SWAP0 |  PC0 |  PC1 | PC2 | PC3 |
| SPI1 ALT1    | SPI1_SWAP1 |  PC4 |  PC5 | PC6 | PC7 |
| SPI1 ALT2    | SPI1_SWAP2 |  PB4 |  PB5 | PB6 | PB7 |

The SPI library only makes one SPIClass object available (see [The SPI.h library documentation](../libraries/SPI/README.md) for details).

### TWI0 mux options
| Mapping | swap | Master or Slave | Dual Mode Slave |
|---------|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| DEFAULT | 0    | SDA/PA2 SCL/PA3 | SDA/PC2 SCL/PC3 |
| ALT1    | 1    | SDA/PA2 SCL/PA3 | SDA/PC6 SCL/PC6 |
| ALT2    | 2    | SDA/PC2 SCL/PC3 | SDA/PC7 SCL/PC7 |

### TWI1 mux options
| Mapping | swap | Master or Slave | Dual Mode Slave |
|---------|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| DEFAULT | 0    | SDA/PF2 SCL/PF3 | SDA/PB2 SCL/PB3 |
| ALT1    | 1    | SDA/PF2 SCL/PF3 | SDA/PB6 SCL/PB7 |
| ALT2    | 2    | SDA/PB2 SCL/PB3 | SDA/PB6 SCL/PB7 |


### PWM Pins
64 pins is a less exciting change than 48, since we had most of our PWM capability already with 48 pins.
* TCA0 is by default set to PORTC. This is a decision I would have made differently had I owned a crystal ball during the design process; but by the time the DB's had arrived with MVIO on PORTC (hence a poor pick for default pins for PWM), the core had been released and we don't like to break backwards compatibility. It's not much of an issue now that you can trivially switch the ports at runtime.
* TCA1 is by default set to PORTB, like on the DA's. Again, this decision is dubious on the DBs where the PORTMUX bug is not present, but since the port assignments are easy to change, I think aligning with the DA64 still made sense. If the AVR128DA64 had working PORTMUX, I'd probably defaulted PG for TCA1.
* TCD0 is left at the default pins on PORTA, because they are the only ones that work.
* The 5 type B timers are set for PF4, PF5, PC0, PC1 and PG3, and this cannot be changed at runtime. Note that the millis timer cannot be used to generate PWM. TCB2 is the default millis timer, though this can be changed from the tools menu.
* This gives 6 + 6 + 2 + 5 = 19 PWM channels simultaneously outputting PWM. 42/54 pins (78%) can output PWM from TCA0, 18 (16.7 or 33.3%) from TCA1, with 8 or 16 (14.8% or 29.6%) having two TCA options.

#### TCA mux options
The Type A timers (TCA0 and TCA1) can be mapped to different pins as a group only, and analogWrite() is PORTMUX-aware - you can set TCA0 to output on any port's pin 0-5, and TCA1 to PORTB. Using this feature is easy - but not quite as trivial as other parts, since there are two bitfields. You simply write to the portmux register `PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA = (TCA1 pinset << 3) | (TCA0 pinset)` and then analogWrite() normally. TCA0 pinset is the port number (0-5 for ports A-F), TCA1 pinsets are from the table below, with numeric values of 0x00, 0x08, 0x10 and 0x18 (It is recommended to use the named constants however, as shown in the example).


| TCA0    | WO0 | WO1 | WO2 | WO3 | WO4 | WO5 |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| PORTA   | PA0 | PA1 | PA2 | PA3 | PA4 | PA5 |
| PORTB   | PB0 | PB1 | PB2 | PB3 | PB4 | PB5 |
| **PORTC** | **PC0** | **PC1** | **PC2** | **PC3** | **PC4** | **PC5** |
| PORTD   | PD0 | PD1 | PD2 | PD3 | PD4 | PD5 |
| PORTE   | PE0 | PE1 | PE2 | PE3 | PE4 | PE5 |
| PORTF   | PF0 | PF1 | PF2 | PF3 | PF4 | PF5 |
| PORTG   | PG0 | PG1 | PG2 | PG3 | PG4 | PG5 |

| TCA1    | WO0 | WO1 | WO2 | WO3 | WO4 | WO5 |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| **PORTB** | **PB0** | **PB1** | **PB2** | **PB3** | **PB4** | **PB5** |
| PORTC   | PC4 | PC5 | PC6 |  -  |  -  |  -  |
| PORTE   | PE4 | PE5 | PE6 |  -  |  -  |  -  |
| PORTG   | PG0 | PG1 | PG2 | PG3 | PG4 | PG5 |

It is strongly recommended to not have any PWM output enabled involving either the timer being moved nor the pins it is being moved to when setting `PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA`. In the latter case, you will not be able to turn off the existing PWM through the API functions.
```c
// Simple Assignment:
PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA = PORTMUX_TCA0_PORTF_gc | PORTMUX_TCA1_PORTB_gc; // PWM on PORTF and PORTB pins 0-5

// one-liner, set TCA0 PORTD (not as readily generalizable):
PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA = (PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA & PORTMUX_TCA1_gm) | PORTMUX_TCA0_PORTD_gc; // Move TCA0 PWM to PORTD but don't change TCA1 PWM
// The first option is slightly faster, as it isn't a read-modify-write. You almost always want TCA1 mux to be set to PORTB.
// Note that PORTMUX_TCA0_PORTA_gc and PORTMUX_TCA1_PORTB_gc have a numeric value of 0.

// Maximally generalizable method (for any multi-bit bitfield w/in a a register):
uint8_t tcaroutea = PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA;  // Registers are volatile variables, so load it to temporary variable to change it in multiple steps
tcaroutea &= ~PORTMUX_TCA0_gm;          // mask off the bits we will change. This method (copy to local var, &= ~THIS_BITFIELD_gm, |= THIS_GROUPCODE_gc ) generalizes better
tcaroutea |= PORTMUX_TCA0_PORTx_gc;     // and then set them to their new value.
PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA = tcaroutea; //since the  then write the temp variable back to the register.

// The above constructions will both give 7 clocks and 6 words and the compiler output identical - lds, andi, ori, sts (while the simple assignment would optimize down to only 3 words, 3 clocks (ldi, sts)).

// In contrast, the naive method:
PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA &= ~PORTMUX_TCA0_gm;
PORTMUX.TCAROUTEA |= PORTMUX_TCA0_PORTx_gc;
// takes 12 clocks/10 words - t has to load the value, modify, and store it, and then reload it, make the second modification, and store it again.
```

#### TCB mux options
| TCBn | Default |  Alt     |
|------|---------|----------|
| TCB0 |    PA2  | **PF4**  |
| TCB1 |    PA3  | **PF5**  |
| TCB2 | **PC0** |  PB4     |
| TCB3 |    PB5  | **PC1**  |
| TCB4 | **PG3** |  PC6     |

These are NOT PORTMUX-aware. Only the **bold** pin can be used without modifying or creating a new variant file. TCAs take priority over TCBs, so without changing the TCA0 mapping, TCB2/TCB3 are not used.

The type B timers are much better utility timers than PWM timers. TCB2 is the default millis timer and cannot be used for PWM in that mode.

#### TCD0 mux options
| TCD0        | WOA     | WOB     | WOC     | WOD     |
|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| **DEFAULT** | **PA4** | **PA5** | **PA6** | **PA7** |
| ALT1        |   ~PB4~ |   ~PB5~ |   ~PB6~ |   ~PB7~ |
| ALT2        |   ~PF0~ |   ~PF1~ |   ~PF2~ |   ~PF3~ |
| ALT3        |   ~PG4~ |   ~PG5~ |   ~PG6~ |   ~PG7~ |

The Type D timer, TCD0, has 2 output channels (WOA and WOB) and 4 output pins (WOA, WOB, WOC, and WOD). The hardware permits WOC and WOD to each output either WOA or WOB, but this added too much complexity to analogWrite; WOA and WOC output WOA, and WOD and WOB output WOB. Calling analogWrite() on either pin will enable it, calling digitalWrite() on that pin will turn the PWM off. Calling analogWrite() on WOC while already outputting on the WOA pin will result in both pins outputting the new duty cycle. Call digital write on first pin if this is not what you want. The datasheet describes TCD0 output on PA4-7, PB4-7, PF0-3, and PG4-7. What the datasheet giveth, the errata taketh away: the alternate pin options are hopelessly broken currently, only PA4-7 work.

### LED_BUILTIN
Following precedent set by MegaCoreX, we declare that pin 7 - `PIN_PA7` shall be the pin that the core "expects" to be connected to an LED. LED_BUILTIN is defined as that pin, and the bootloader will set that pin as output and try to blink the LED. Note that if the bootloader is not used, and your sketch does not reference `LED_BUILTIN` this pin is not otherwise treated any differently. This can be overridden if a custom board definition is created by passing `-DLED_BUILTIN = (some other pin)` in the `build.extra_flags` field.

### Reset pin can be input
Reset (PF6) can be set to work as an input *(but never an output)*. The UPDI pin cannot be configured as an I/O pin.

### ADC pins in differential mode
Only pins on PORTD and PORTE can be used as the negative side of a differential analog reading (`analogReadDiff()`). Pins on PORTF can be used as positive or single ended ADC inputs only.

## Official Documentation
When all else fails, read the real documentation. They keep moving the .pdf files around, so now I just link to the prduct page, from whence the datasheet, errata, and "technical briefs".

**Datasheets and errata change. You can sign up to get emails about such changes through the Microchip PCN system; if you don't, be sure to always use the latest version of the datasheet and especially the errata**

* [AVR128DB64 product page](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/AVR128DB64)
* [AVR64DB64 product page](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/AVR64DB64)

At a minimum, everyone using a modern AVR should plan on having a PDF viewer open with the datasheet, and a text editor with a good search function and the ioavr______.h file open so that when you're trying to use a constant, but the compiler says it isn't declared/defined, you can search the io header for a key phrase in the constant and figure out how it was spelled/formatted or copy/paste it to your sketch. (see [the IO headers](./ioheaders) for more information and links to them. I also keep the AVR instruction set manual open in the PDF viewer as well as the silicon errata and datasheet clarification. Datasheet clarifications are a bigger deal than an erratum, usually. An erratum says "Okay, this doesn't work, but it will some day, maybe" while a datasheet clarification says either "This would be an errata, but we're not even going to pretend that we'll fix it some day" or occasionally "there is poor communication between the engineering and documentation departments".

### Technical briefs
Technical briefs are what Microchip calls the sort of documents that most of the industry refers to as "app notes". Technical brief is an apt term, as it covers the wide range of usefulness and detail that can be seen in the technical briefs: Some of these are briefs as in a briefing, like what would be given to a military commander for making strategic decisions, and are highly useful. Other "technical briefs" are simply "brief", that is, short. This is not always bad, but sometimes a technical brief ends up FAR too brief and covers a topic that deserves considerably more discussion (the "product brief" is the extreme of this - in the past what is now called a "product brief" may have been called a "datasheet summary". There are also nn unfortunate few of the "technical briefs" that are even less helpful. Here the name is still apt, but in this case, it's in the sense of the article of clothing of that name: they cover the ass ("Yeah, we have a technical brief explaining that functionality"), but achieve little more. While they may be a starting point, you'd need a lot more to go anywhere. One gets the impression that the tech briefs are sometimes written by people who really know how the feature works at a very deep level, resulting in useful informative documents, others are written somewhat more abstractly, as if the writer has understanding, but little realworld experience, and in the worst tech briefs, it seems to have been written by someone who has no actual eperience using the features, and are going completely from the datasheet and maybe a scrawled set of notes from engineering - but are writing with precious little understanding.

A fair portion of tech briefs are essentially useless - but there are also some really insightful and solid ones that are of great utility. They cannot be distinguished without reading them, but once you start reading, you very rapidly will realize which kind you have.
