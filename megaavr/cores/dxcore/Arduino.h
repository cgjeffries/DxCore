// Currently DxCore has no cases where the millis timer isn't derived from system clock, but that will change

/* Timers and Timer-like-things
 * These are used for two things: Identifying the timer on a pin in
 * digitalPinToTimer(), and for the MILLIS_TIMER define that users can test to
 * verify which timer is being used for millis.
 *
 * Prior to 1.3.x TCAs were all 0x1_, TCBs 0x2_. But in order to make the
 * take-over tracking work efficiently I needed a dedicated bit for each TCA.
 * so that we can just do (__PeripheralControl | TIMERA0) to test if user has
 * taken over the timer. Hence, all the "big" timers (those which have a
 * takeOverTCxn() function and which PORTMUX moves en masse instead of one at
 * a time) have their own bit within these macros.
 * Note also that the digital_pin_to_timer table doesn't list these anymore.\
 * There are two functions within the core that need to know this:
 * AnalogWrite, and turnOffPWM. These each carry their own implementation of
 * logic to identify the timer and channel; the only other cases in which these
 * pins need to be identified are within user code, where the pin mapping can
 * be chosen freely (subject to user code needing access to other pins), so
 * it does not present the complexity of the core library which must work with
 * the pins in ANY of 7, 2, or 5 mappings (for TCA0, TCA1 and TCD0 respectively)
 *
 * Prior to this change, only the arbitrarily chosen core default timer pin-
 * mapping was supported, so this was a dramatic leap forward in capabilitt.
 *
 * The DAC is listed here because analogWrite() uses it almost exactly like
 * a PWM timer.
 * RTC can be used as a millis timekeeping source (well, not currently on
 * DxCore, but it can on megaTinyCore, and might one day be possible on DxCore
 * though I'm not sure I want to implement it that way).

 * For the millis timer, there's nothing weird here.
 * But the timer table constants contain more information than that for these. When user code interprets the timer table entries it is critical to do it right:
 *  1. If 0x80 is set, either it's the dacout (if no other bits are set) or
 *    a. If 0x40 also set, it's TYPE F timer, and the 3 bits contain the mux option, and the 4th bit is 1 for WO1.
 *    b. Further type F timers will increment the high nybble.
 *    c. If 0x40 not set but 0x10 is, it's TYPE E timer, and the 3 bits contain the mux option, and the 4th bit is 1 for a hypothetical TCE1
 *    d. Otherwise it's either DACOUT, or one of the RTC options, and your not looking at the timer table.
 *  2. If 0x80 not set, but 0x40 is set, TCD0 can output here. bits 4 and 5 contain information on what channel, and bits 0-2 specify what the PORTMUX must be set to.
 *  2. If 0x20 is set, there is a TCB can output PWM there.
 *    2a. If 0x20 is set, check 0x10 - if that's set, it's the alt pin mapping. This is currently not returned by the table, and I assess it to be unlikely to be of use
 *  4. If 0x10 is set, it's a TCA0 pin. This is never used in the timer table, but digitalPinToTimerNow() can return it. The low three bits may be included to specify the TCA mux that the pin is present on
 *  5. If 0x08 is set, it's a TCA1 pin. This is never used in the timer table, but digitalPinToTimerNow() can return it. The low three bits may be included to specify the TCA mux that the pin is present on
